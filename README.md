# LabControl

LabControl is designed to monitor and control your process equipment in a laboratory or plant. 
Consolidate all your sensor and controller output data and plot the data real-time for monitoring processes. 
For example, temperature, pressure, mass, voltage, or any other reading from your process equipment can be integrated into LabControl.
Also, data can be exported for future analysis.
